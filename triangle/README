Testing
-------
Run 'ant test' to run all test cases.

Coverage
--------
Run './coverage.sh' to compute the coverage results.
After completion, you can view the detailed html coverage report:
coverage_results/index.html

Mutation
--------
Run './mutation.sh' to compute the mutation score.
After completion, the following files in the 'mutation_results' directory provide
additional information about the generated, killed, and live mutants:
killed.csv:  a summary of whether a mutant is still live or was killed with an
             exception/assertion/timeout.
summary.csv: a one-line summary that indicates how many mutants were generated
             and killed, and how long the analysis took.
mutants.log: a summary of the generated mutants (i.e., what part of the code was
             changed and how).

Rather than reading the mutants.log file, you can show the source code differences between
a mutant and the original version by running:
'./show_mutant.sh <mutant ID>'

For example, the following command shows how mutant 1 differs from the original (i.e.,
unmutated) version:
'./show_mutant.sh 1'

The output is a unified diff that indicates what line the mutation step changed:
--- src/triangle/Triangle.java
+++ .mutated/mutants/1/triangle/Triangle.java
@@ -20 +20 @@
-        if (a <= 0 || b <= 0 || c <= 0) {
+        if (a <= 1 || b <= 0 || c <= 0) {

The line starting with '@@' indicates the line number of the changed source code line
(20 in this example). The line starting with '- ' shows the removed line, and the line
starting with '+ ' shows the line that replaced it.
